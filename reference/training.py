"""# Fine-tune a pretrained model

There are significant benefits to using a pretrained model. It reduces computation costs, your carbon footprint, and allows you to use state-of-the-art models without having to train one from scratch. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides access to thousands of pretrained models for a wide range of tasks. When you use a pretrained model, you train it on a dataset specific to your task. This is known as fine-tuning, an incredibly powerful training technique. In this tutorial, you will fine-tune a pretrained model with a deep learning framework of your choice:

* Fine-tune a pretrained model with ðŸ¤— Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer).
* Fine-tune a pretrained model in TensorFlow with Keras.
* Fine-tune a pretrained model in native PyTorch.

# """Before you can fine-tune a pretrained model, download a dataset and prepare it for training. The previous tutorial showed you how to process data for training, and now you get an opportunity to put those skills to the test!

"""As you now know, you need a tokenizer to process the text and include a padding and truncation strategy to handle any variable sequence lengths.

"""ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) class optimized for training ðŸ¤— Transformers models, making it easier to start training without manually writing your own training loop. The [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) API supports a wide range of training options and features such as logging, gradient accumulation, and mixed precision.

Start by loading your model and specify the number of expected labels. From the Yelp Review [dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_full#data-fields), you know there are five labels:
"""

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased", num_labels=5)

"""<Tip>

You will see a warning about some of the pretrained weights not being used and some weights being randomly
initialized. Don't worry, this is completely normal! The pretrained head of the BERT model is discarded, and replaced with a randomly initialized classification head. You will fine-tune this new model head on your sequence classification task, transferring the knowledge of the pretrained model to it.

</Tip>

### Training hyperparameters

Next, create a [TrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) class which contains all the hyperparameters you can tune as well as flags for activating different training options. For this tutorial you can start with the default training [hyperparameters](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments), but feel free to experiment with these to find your optimal settings.

Specify where to save the checkpoints from your training:
"""

training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="test_trainer")

"""### Metrics

[Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) does not automatically evaluate model performance during training. You will need to pass [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) a function to compute and report metrics. The ðŸ¤— Datasets library provides a simple [`accuracy`](https://huggingface.co/metrics/accuracy) function you can load with the `load_metric` (see this [tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/metrics.html) for more information) function:
"""

import numpy as np
from datasets import load_metric

metric = load_metric("accuracy")

"""Call `compute` on `metric` to calculate the accuracy of your predictions. Before passing your predictions to `compute`, you need to convert the predictions to logits (remember all ðŸ¤— Transformers models return logits):"""

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
    return metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)

"""If you'd like to monitor your evaluation metrics during fine-tuning, specify the `evaluation_strategy` parameter in your training arguments to report the evaluation metric at the end of each epoch:"""

from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="test_trainer", evaluation_strategy="epoch")

"""### Trainer

Create a [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) object with your model, training arguments, training and test datasets, and evaluation function:

"""[Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) takes care of the training loop and allows you to fine-tune a model in a single line of code. For users who prefer to write their own training loop, you can also fine-tune a ðŸ¤— Transformers model in native PyTorch.

At this point, you may need to restart your notebook or execute the following code to free some memory:
"""

# del model

"""Next, manually postprocess `tokenized_dataset` to prepare it for training.

1. Remove the `text` column because the model does not accept raw text as an input:

    ```py
    >>> tokenized_datasets = tokenized_datasets.remove_columns(["text"])
    ```

2. Rename the `label` column to `labels` because the model expects the argument to be named `labels`:

    ```py
    >>> tokenized_datasets = tokenized_datasets.rename_column("label", "labels")
    ```

3. Set the format of the dataset to return PyTorch tensors instead of lists:

    ```py
    >>> tokenized_datasets.set_format("torch")
    ```

Then create a smaller subset of the dataset as previously shown to speed up the fine-tuning:
"""

small_train_dataset = tokenized_datasets["train"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000))
small_eval_dataset = tokenized_datasets["test"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000))

"""### DataLoader

Create a `DataLoader` for your training and test datasets so you can iterate over batches of data:

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased", num_labels=5)

"""### Optimizer and learning rate scheduler

Create an optimizer and learning rate scheduler to fine-tune the model. Let's use the [`AdamW`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.AdamW.html) optimizer from PyTorch:
"""

from torch.optim import AdamW

optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

num_training_steps = num_epochs * len(train_dataloader)
lr_scheduler = get_scheduler(
    name="linear", optimizer=optimizer, num_warmup_steps=0, num_training_steps=num_training_steps

"""Lastly, specify `device` to use a GPU if you have access to one. Otherwise, training on a CPU may take several hours instead of a couple of minutes."""

import torch

device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")

</Tip>

Great, now you are ready to train! ðŸ¥³

### Training loop

To keep track of your training progress, use the [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) library to add a progress bar over the number of training steps:
"""

        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()

        optimizer.step()
        lr_scheduler.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        progress_bar.update(1)

"""### Metrics

Just like how you need to add an evaluation function to [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer), you need to do the same when you write your own training loop. But instead of calculating and reporting the metric at the end of each epoch, this time you will accumulate all the batches with [`add_batch`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html?highlight=add_batch#datasets.Metric.add_batch) and calculate the metric at the very end.
"""

metric = load_metric("accuracy")
model.eval()
for batch in eval_dataloader:
    batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**batch)

    logits = outputs.logits
    predictions = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)
    metric.add_batch(predictions=predictions, references=batch["labels"])

metric.compute()
